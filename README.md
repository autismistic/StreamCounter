**StreamCounter** is a dual-counter application designed for streamers and gamers to track in-game metrics like deaths, scores, or other stats in real-time. Built with Python and Tkinter, it offers a user-friendly interface with customizable features, including hotkey support, font and background customization, adjustable viewer spacing, and a combined viewer for easy integration with streaming software like OBS Studio.
